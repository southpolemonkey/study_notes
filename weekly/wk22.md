## Understand user context in designing dashboard

> One of the biggest challenges of dashboard design is serving multiple personas. Once each user role is defined, it becomes critical to understand where their needs overlap and where they diverge.


> Taking this in mind, it’s a good idea to start with rudimentary wireframes and move on to prototypes that can be tested with actual users during a user research phase. 

--> Five users is enough for getting feedbacks for prototype

## Stat Quest

** Ridge Regression **

To solve the problem when experiments are fewer than parameters, say 10000 parameters but only 500 row of data.

Ridge regression penalty

Use cross validation to find $lambda$

Lasso regression

Elastic-Net regression
