what is p value? typical example with drug test. You should be aware that p value doesn't imply the effect size, e.g p=0.2 does not imply bigger difference than p=0.05.

p-value indicates our tolerance for accepting false positive. False positive does not come without thinking for me now.

one-sided: dangerours

two-sides

p value consist of three factors:
- probability of target events happen
- probability of same rare events happen
- probability of more extreme events happen

in other words
- The probability random chance would result in the observation
- The probability of observing something else that is equally rare
- The probability of observing something rarer or more extreme
