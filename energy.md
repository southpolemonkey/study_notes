This repo comes from the idea for monitoring electricity usage. And then later expanded into a place for storing knowledge of energy industry.

main providers:
- agl
- red energe
- [Origin Energe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Energy)
- [Snowy hydro](https://www.snowyhydro.com.au/)

business model:

large energe companies have their own power stations, small companies probably sell large companies's quota through their own sale channel.
From this perspective, it works kinda similar to telecom industry.

pricing models:

electric supply rates in NSW: 90.45 c/day ([reference](https://www.canstarblue.com.au/electricity/electricity-supply-charges/))
