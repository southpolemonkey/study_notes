what is DNS forward? 

[what is ChinaDNS?](https://github.com/shadowsocks/ChinaDNS)

 Traditional way to bypass DNS poisoning is to send all queries to a foreign DNS server via VPN. However some Chinese websites will get bad results if they have CDNs outside the country.

 The second way is to maintain a list of domains of which you want to resolve from local DNS or foreign DNS. This list changes too often, taking too much effort to maintain.

 ChinaDNS automatically queries local DNS servers to resolve Chinese domains and queries foreign DNS servers to resolve foreign domains. It is smart enough to work only with a Chinese IP range file, which doesn't change often.
