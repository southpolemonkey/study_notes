### Question
Should parents be held legally responsible for the actions of their children. Do you agree with this opinion? Support your position with your own study, experience or observations.

### Answer
With the increasing rate of juvenile dilinquency in recent years, there has been a heated debate on whether 
parents should be legally responsible for the illegal behaviours of their children. From my perspective, 
parents have responsibility in educating their children, but not be held for children's illegal action.

On one hand, it is undoubtable that law says that parents are responsible for their children's safety and upbring. In specific, 
parents are the only person who have privilege to educate and control behaviours at the first stage during their lives. Children's behaviours
somehow reflects parents' behaviours. For example, if parents speak loud in public space, without being aware of its behaviours' impact on the
surroundings, children are likely to pick up these improper habits. In addition, according to a recent report released
by NSW Police, lacking of parental supervisor ranks the top reason of teenager crime in Australia, which reflects the role of guidance from parents
in preventing juvenile delingquency.

Nevertheless, there's no clear regulation or laws says that parents should be caught after their children commit crimes.
Also, parents cannot always be their side during their growing up, they can't prevent children from being influenced by outside world, especially social media.
For instance, violence and illegal behaviours depicted in social media, movies has negative impact on children's behaviours. Because they lack the ability
to judge the right or wrong, they would imitate these behaviours without realising it's illegal. In the worst case, teenagers even commit crimes to
their parents, who is victims in these scenario.

In conclusion, parents shares the most responsibility to guide their children to obey the law and become a good citizen. However,
it is unrealistic and unfair to require parents to be held legally responsible for children's illegal actions.

### Notes
Agree:
- the law said parents are responsible for their childrenâ€™s safety and upbringing. 
- the only person who have right to educate and control their children behaviors at the first stage during their lives
- lack of parental supervisor and parents irresponsibly is the most reasons for teenager crime in current society

Disagree:
- not clear regulation or law to say parents should do
- easier to be influenced by the outside world
- not listening to their parents or even commit a crime to their parent!
- cannot always be their sides during they growing up.
