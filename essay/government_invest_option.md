Government fund in art vs public transportation or health?
===

Although many people think art is the indispensable part of their life, other people argue that the investment on the former is less import tant than other public services, such as health and education. From my perspective, health and education are the underlying issues which should never be postponed, but the role of art also needs to be emphasized,

Those who support the investment to artistic may give reason as follows. Firstly, Art provides people various means of entertainment and relieve pressure from working. Take office workers as an example, after a day's work, they may want to go to the theatre, gallery or cinema to entertain themselves and forget the tireness from work temporarily. In addition, some artistic projects, which were created by ancient rennowned masters, are valuable treasures, representing the history of a country and its cultural identity, hence the government has the obligation to preserve them.

On the other hand, other people argue that the government should focus its funds on health and education, which could bring more benefit to people's welfare. For instance, if the government spend more money on building public libraries, people would have easier access to educatin resources, which helps to improve the overall education level. Also, healthcare condition are not optimistic in all areas. The shortage of medical resources make it hard to people to receive proper treatment when they fail ill. It is urgent for the authorities to raise investment on healthcare.

In my view, the improvement of public services and the construction of basic facilities are undoubtedly urgent that call for government priority. However, the role of arts should not be neglected or denied, as the benefits of artistic activities may be less visible, but they meets the **spiritual needs** of people.
