## Learning from school or internet

Learning from internet and tv becomes common among students, while some people think attending school is still an essential way for students to gain knowledge. I think this point is resonable.

Indeed, Internet provides students with easy access to extensive information. Modern digital devices are even more knowledgable than the teachers in school, as they can retrieve answers to any questions you would ask. TV also broadens student's scope of knowledge, for example, National Geography is a good supplementary to the geographical lessons. However, that does not mean students do not need to go to school and attend class any more.

~~Students can learn more than knowledge in school~~. There are many things that can not be acquired from internet and TV. To begin with, teachers are expected to be the role model ~~for students~~ in study and morality. They are professionals in education, who can inspire students to think and guide them to contribute to the society, which can not be achieved by internet and TV. In school, students also learn to respect seniors and obey the rules, which is crucial for their behaviour in the future.

In addition, students can meet classmates from different backgounds, which helps them to build communication skills and learn how to handle disputes among group. These kinds of experiences are significant to a person' growth and help students to reflect their own value in the group, making them to think what role they can play in the future, and what value they could contribute to the society.

To conclude, students should be encourged to make use of modern technology to ~~gain~~ expand knowledge through different channels, including internet and TV. However, the importance of traditional schooling should never be underestimated as they play an essential role in a person's growth.
