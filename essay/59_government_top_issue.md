###Question
The world’s governments and organizations are facing a lot of issues. Which do you think is the most pressing problem for the inhabitants on our planet and give the solution?

###Answer
In the competitive world and era, there is an ongoing debate about issues that the world’s governments and organizations are faced. Among all these issues, climate change is becoming a global topic that can no longer be ignored by governments, corporations and the general public.

The impact of climate change will be catastrophic if not being controlled to the minimum level. For instance, biodiversity will be dramatically reduced as animals and plants cannot adapt themselves to the extreme weather, which leads to the extinction of endangered species. Also, climate change may intensify extreme weather such as floods, droughts, and storms, which is detrimental to human life. The recent news of the longest drought happened in Australia's history is clear evidence of the consequence of climate change.

To combat climate change, both governments, organizations and the general public should share parts of the responsibilities. Governments should play the chief role in fighting climate change as they have the legislative, administrative and executive power. For example, laws and regulations could be published to deter the activities which are detrimental to the environment and motivate every single citizen to protect the environment.

Besides, organizations, especially multinational companies, should apply low emission and environmentally friendly manufacturing processes for environmental protection. The practice could make a substantial difference in slowing the process of climate change, reducing pollution and saving natural resources.

To conclude, governments, organizations and individuals are all playing big roles in stopping climate change and should take responsibility to contribute to protecting the earth together.
