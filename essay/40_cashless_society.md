### Question
There are more and more situations using credit cards instead of cash. It seems that cashless society is becoming a reality. How realistic do you think it is ? And do you think it brings benefits or problems?


### Answer
A cashless society might sound like something out of science fiction, but we’re already on our way. It enables more countries
to transform into the cashless world, but the potential risks should not be neglected. In my opinion, cashless society's benefits outweigh the
potential risks.

To begin with, paying with card is convenient for daily life, for example, people can just bring one piece of card to buy a million values dollars. In addition, cashless society
means less crime, where theft has less cash to steal. Also, it helps to eliminate illegal transaction, for example, drug deal typically
take place with cash so that there's no record of the transaction. But in cashless world, the deal has no place to hide as each transaction can be recorded. 

Moreover, in cashless society, people spend less time and costs associated with handling paper money as well as storing and depositing it,
which reduce the labour needs and free the productivity. An extra benefits is international payments, take oversea travel as an example,
people on longer need to buy local currency because the payments are easy if both nations can handle cashless transcation, which means all the currency exchange
can be handled by the backend system.

Regardless of the enormous benefits, going cashless might actually be problematic. Electronic payments mean less privacy, it exposes your personal
information to possible data breach. For example, if someone hacks into your bank account and steal your savings, your would have no alternative source 
of money, which is catastrophic to people's life. In addition, paying without cash increases the risk of overspending, when people swipe or tap
their card, they are less aware of how much they have spent. As a result, consumers need to put effort in reviewing their spendings.

To conclude, the cashless society looks promising and we are running into it at high speed, but 
we need to address several social issues before giving up on cash entirely.
