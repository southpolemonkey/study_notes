###  Question
Large shopping malls are replacing small local shops in cities and towns. In your own experience,
is it a positive development or not?

### Answer
In past decades, shopping malls have grown rapidly and transformed the urban lifestyle. With the disappearance of some local shops, people began to wonder whether this pattern is positive or not? In my opinion, this development pattern improves people's life quality and brings convenience, while may take away the specialty that only belongs to local shops.

There is no denying that shopping hall gives the convenience of getting our daily needs including groceries, clothes, shoes, books and so on under one roof, which saves people life in shopping and bargain because the price is fixed. Besides, shopping malls can ensure the quality as they set standards on the providers to guarantee the quality meet the requirements, which saves time and money for customers.

Regardless of the enormous advantages, they do have disadvantages. The proliferation of shopping malls has seized the living space for local and small shops, therefore these shop owners are losing the jobs for earning a living. As a result, only a few customers buy products in local shops, which greatly affects the local economy. 

Shopping malls also increases the risk of overspending, as people are likely to buy unnecessary things promoted by the sales advertisements.  Additionally, small shops are not only a place for purchasing but also a community center,  which links people together for sharing life stories. Therefore, local shops usually give people a sense of belonging whereas shopping malls can rarely offer.

In conclusion, the appearance of shopping malls is a symbol of urbanization and it improves people's life quality. However, local shops reflect the health of the local economy, and it should not be replaced totally.
