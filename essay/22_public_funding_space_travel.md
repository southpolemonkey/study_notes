### Question
Space travel is fantanstic these days, but there are many issues, such as environment
problem, that we should focus on. What are your views on the allocation of public funding?

### Answer
In recent years, space travel has been allocated a great number of funds in most developed countries,
such as the United States, England, and China. However, there is an opposite voice that these funds should be
used in resolving environmental problems. From my perspective, the environmental problem should be concerned while space travel leads to a brighter future.

On one hand, the rapid increase of the global population has taken up the majority of livable lands on earth, in other words, 
the shortage of living space has appeared as a serious social problem, which affects people's life quality. Therefore, space travel
could explore the potential planets similar to earth in outer space, where people can survive with oxygen and water.
Government allocates funds in space travel can greatly improve the advance in such area, which makes the plan sending people to Mars come 
true soon.

On the other hand, there's no doubt that human being is facing environmental issues, such as global warming and air pollution. The earth
has been polluted since industrial revolutions. In addition, there are many areas in poverty and childern
can't go to school, government should help provide better sanitation condition to these areas, also provides education
facilities. Hence, it is worth for government to spend money in
solve environment issues to create a better earth for us.

In conclusion, the environment affects our living conditions, which should be placed at the top priority. However, space travel relates to human's future, therefore, it's worth for government to invest the public's fund in
this field.
