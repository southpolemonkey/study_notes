### Question
With the increase of digital media available online, the role of the library has become obsolete.
Universities should only procure digital media rather than constantly updating textbooks. Discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of this position and give your own point of view.

### Answer
With the development of digital age in the pasting decades, people wonder whether the printed book is 
necessary or not. It becomes a heated debate topic that whether universities should continue to update textbooks instead of just
subscribe digital media. In my opinion, the printed books is indispensable for the community.

To begin with, digital media give people convenience to access all kinds of information. Modern digital devices are even more knowledgable than the teachers in school, as they can retrieve answers to any questions you would ask. 
In addition, according to Green Reading, a NGO based in Australia, a recent report showed that the State Library of NSW has saved hundreds of tons of paper
since they replaced 30% of printed books with digital version.

Regardless of its advantages, it should be noted that printed books is indispensable in providing information to people in rural areas. For example, in lower-income countries, like Cambodia, where people don't have access to internet and modern digital devices, they need access to reliable information.
Not only do they need vital information about health, safety, nutrition and public services, but they also want opportunities to develop their literacy, learn skills for employability, and take part in collective educational and cultural activities.
Hence, libraries need enough printed books to feed their visitors.

To conclude, in urbanized areas, increasing the percentage of digital books should be encouraged to meet people's reading behaviour, while it also should be noted that printed books
play a vital role in areas where internet has reached yet. 

### Note
- People in rural area don't have access to internet or ability to access to digital information

> The same quiet reading and study areas will be there for those who need it, but the library will be also be used as a cultural and social space where people can come together to watch theatre and film screenings, or take part in workshops, seminars, meetings, author talks and fashion events.
