# Age Discrimination

> Age discrimination occurs when a decision is made on the basis of a personâ€™s age. In the workplace, these are most often decisions about being employed in the first place, winning promotions or being unfairly dismissed. Should discrimination against older workers be made illegal?

support:
- prvoide reasonable and fair job market
- having few older workers increases the amount the government needs to speed on unemployment
- 

- potentially older workers may end up at the position for a longer period, which eliminate the opportunities for young employees.

real life examples
- Australia issued anti-discrimination law in 2004

There has been debates whether age discrimination towards ager workers should be treated as illegal or not. Supporters think to eliminate such descrimination could create a reasonable and fair environment. Personally, I think it's a good pratice to make it become a rule.
