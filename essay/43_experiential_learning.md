### Question
Some people point that experiential learning (i.e. learning by doing it) can work well in formal education. However, others think a traditional form of teaching is the best. Do you think experiential learning CAN WORK WELL in high schools or colleges?


### Answer
Although many people think experiential learning gives students more experience while learning, others argue that
traditional education is the best. From my perspective, experiential learning is a good supplementary to traditional teaching,
but there are certain aspects need to be considered before school adopts it.

Those who support experiential education may give reasons as follow. Firstly, learning by doing is more efficient and direct
way for students to gain knowledge and skills, as they can put the theory into practice, which deepens their understanding of the concepts.
Take physics as an example, if students can observe the motion of magnetics with their own eyes, they will understand the principles
easily. In addition, experiential learning improves enthusiasm and motivation towards learning. Unlike the tradition learning which requires 
memorizing lots of concepts, students are encouraged to think creatively to seek their unique way to fulfill the solution to a hands-on-task.
Hence, students excels at problem solving and trouble shooting.

On the other hand, there are several restrictions when school try to implement experiential learning. First, both school and students 
should be aware that experiential learning means longer learning span, which means student reflect from the mistakes in the practice. Hence,
traditional teaching is more efficient in delivering knowledge in a systematic way. Also, this new teaching method needs equipments
and materials, and schools need teachers specialized in experiential teaching, all these extra financial requirements would become burden
for students as well as schools.

To conclude, experiential learning, compared with traditional learning, undoubtedly has unique advantages. However, it is still unrealistic for 
schools to replace the traditional learning completely considering the cost of this new approach.


 

### Notes
Topic 43 Experimental learning in high school AD & DIS (VS. traditional teaching form) 

Pros:
- gain more career opportunities due to a solid connection between school and industrial company
- easier for their self-cognition about future career field planning while real life engagement
- more efficient and direct way to gain knowledge and skills
- opportunity for Creativity and Reflection : seek their own way unique and most fulfilling solution to a hands-on-task
- mistakes become valuable, not fear mistakes in the future.
- improve enthusiasm (continues attitude) toward learning 

Cons:
- the school should be responsible for improving studentsâ€™ intellectual knowledge in the limited time. Traditional teaching approach is more efficient way. Primary Intellectual commitment and confidence is much more valuable for students at this age.
- waste time and less knowledge can input into students
- financial risks for both student and school due to each project cost money on equipment.
- difficult for supervisor and management: experimental learning often conveys in a small group of students which will break the original faculty and student ratio.
