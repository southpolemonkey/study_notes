## Some organizations integrate employees in decision making process of their goods and services. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.

In the modern organisations, it is common for organizations to take employees into the decision stages of the goods and services. This approach, in my view, could bring organizations benefits and give employees more sense of involvments, while also have some risks should not be neglected.

Company used to be centralised in the past, the decisions are made by its owner or board members, for example, the multinational organisations. Firstly, having employees included in the decision making process brings a sense of responsibility and commitment. Otherwise, employees would feel weak relationship with the organization's future direction. For example, ...

Additionally, involvements would spark creativity and new ideas, which stimulates organizations' developments. Take internet companies as example, lots of creative ideas are proposed by young employees, as their mind are not restricted by the existed rules yet. Therefore, it is wise for decision makers to ask for opinions from employees.

~~On the other hand, it is worthy mentioning that having too many people involved in the decision process would make it difficult to make the final decision. For instance, everybody would propose their idea but most of these ideas would be unrealistic to achieve, considering the organization's resources or limitations. A good example is that startup company is fast at making decision. Although they make mistakes due to the fast decisions, they could correct them in the next round decision, which make them agile, instead of stuck into one problem for long period.~~

On the other hand, there are some decisions which organizations considered classified and are not supposed to be shared with employees, due to sensitivity or the risk of exposing them. In such cases there is no need for company to consult staffs before making such decisions. For example, Coal Cola lost parts of market to adversary because one of their employers had  **privy** information of formula and disclose it to Pepsi, one of their main competitors.

To conclude, ~~i hold the view combine employees into organization's decision is beneficial for the organization's overall development~~, there are both advantages and disadvantages in **integrating** workers in decision making of a company. Nevertheless, I believe the merits outweighs and organizations would benefit more from such practice.
