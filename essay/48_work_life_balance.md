### Question
The time people devote in job leaves very little time for personal life. How widespread is the problem? What problem will this shortage of time cause?

### Answer
Nowadays, people devote more time in job and leave little time to personal life. This pattern is especially prevalent among 
middle-aged people due to to financial pressure. From my perspective, in the long term, it may lead to serious social issues
such as increasing divorce rate and the decline of citizen's health level.

To begin with, the prevalence of this problem depends on age group and industry. The lack of work life balance usually exists among
middle age group in which people are faced with external pressure and internal pressure. The internal pressure consists of family
financial pressure, including monthly mortgage payment, children's education cost and ageing care cost. While the external
pressure comes from competitions with young employees and promotion pressures within organizations. Take IT industry for example,
employees need to continuously learn new technologies to avoid own skill sets becoming obsolete, the anxiety makes people sacrifice their
personal time to study new skills.

The consequences can be catastrophic. Firstly, long work hours posts threats to people's health, both physically and mentally.
According to a recent report by the Economist, nearly 10% of Audit industry employees could suffer from different levels of
mental disorder throughout their career life. In addition, the lacking of commitment to family affects the marital
relationship, which may lead to a higher divorce rate, hence become a social problem. The higher divorce rate could even have 
impact on country's birth rate, which exacerbates the aging problems in developed countries such as Japan and Germany.

To conclude, the lack of work and life balance is detrimental to people's personal life as well as
the society's development. Hence, it is vital for industry and government to improve employees' welfare and take
work life balance into consideration.
