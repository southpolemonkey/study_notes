### Question:
Some people think that the design of buildings has affect, either positively or negatively, on where people work and live. To what extent you agree or disagree.

### Notes
In recent years, whether the design of buildings has a positive or negative impact on people's life has sparked a heated debate. From my perspective, architecture has a substantial influence on our daily lives.

To begin with, the primary purpose of architecture is to provide shelters for people to prevent them from dangers and hazard weather. In other words, the quality of buildings largely affects the dwelling's life and safety. If the building is poorly designed, it poses threats to people's life. For example, thousands of people died in Wen Chuan Earthquake in 2008, and they were not killed by the earthquake but the collapse of buildings, buildings with unreliable structures and safety risks. On the contrary, did the buildings resist the energy of the earthquake could people have enough time to evacuate from the premises, which increases the chance of surviving dramatically.

Secondly, good architecture affects people's mood and motivation. In other words, space we live and work has impacts on our mental health. For instance, people have exposure to sunlight are more likely to feel happy and relaxed, compared to those who work in space with less sunlight such as underground. Besides, excellent architecture creates fantastic public space, which stimulates the communication and collaboration between the citizens, encourages people to build relationships with the surroundings and gains a sense of belongings to the community.

Furthermore, good architecture welcomes all kinds of people and eliminate bias and prejudice. Take disabled people as an example, if we are talking about a person with insufficient walking ability, then whether a building provides easy access for the disabled becomes criteria to evaluate the building. Hence, a good building would create easy access to any level of people.

To conclude, I agree with the point that the design of architecture influences where people work and live, the influence could be either positive or negative. Hence, good design is vital for us.
