Do you think formal written assessments in today's world to assess studentsâ€™performance is effective or not? Discuss your viewpoint on this and support your answer with examples.

### Answer
In this information society, whether students in the university should be continously be evaluated by written tests has become a heated decate topic. Even though it is claimed by some authorities that this pattern boasts the validity in the current education system, I strongly disgres with this view with my reasons as follow.

Firstly, written assessments are believed not universally effectively any more. To be more specific, this examination methodology is not productive or capable to evaluate a learner's verable ability or interaction skills. For instance, hardly can a two-hour paper-based final exam verify student's accurary of pronunciation and their communication skills.

Additionally, written examinations may involve the issues such as plagiarism. In particular, not only does this compromise the authenticity of the test result, but also the reputation of education providers. Furthermore, this patterns are also not of pragmatics nor comprehensiveness, as they merely test a student's short memory and theoretical knowledge instead of practical skills.

Truly the majority of universities and colleges are predominantly adopting written assignments as part of the examinations. However, it is noticeable that this formal assessment has already been combined with other approaches such as group discussion, individual oral presentation and external stuides to ensure that students' abilities would be fairly and comprehensively evaluated.

In conclusion, although there are some voices still advocating critical status of written examinations, I maintain the point that this way of assessment is no longer valid if implemented alone, as it undoubtedly has pitfalls related to plagiarism along with the issue of the lack of comprehensiveness. Therefore, only by incoporating other forms of examinations could a student's real ability be reflected fully.
