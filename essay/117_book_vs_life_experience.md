### Answer
Some people argue that life experience is the best teacher and can teach more than textbooks and school, while others think the formal school education is still essential. From my perspective, this view is reasonable.

Indeed, life experience brings enormous benefits to students. Life provides students the opportunities to apply theories from classrooms into practice, the motivation of seeing the knowledge come true helps students to speed up the absorb of new knowledge. Besides, students can enhance communication skills, social skills through and broaden their horizons through the process of making friends from different ages and cultural backgrounds. Also, the real-life experience can help students with their career developments and improve competitiveness in future job hunting.

However, all these advantages from life experiences do not mean students can bypass the formal school education stage anymore. Many things cannot be acquired from life experiences. To begin with, school education provides a solid basis of knowledge in well-designed systematic courses, students can have a grasp of fundamental theories and essential principles that lay the foundations for their future works.

Additionally, school education helps students to enhance critical thinking through subjects such as mathematics and physics. These kinds of exercises are significant to a person's analytics skills and help students to develop tight logic and rigorous thinking, enabling them to have solid reasoning skills.

To conclude, students should be encouraged to gain life experience to gain practical knowledge through different sources. However, the importance of traditional schooling should never be underestimated as they play an essential role in a person's growth.
