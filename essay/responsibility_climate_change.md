### Combat climate change

Nowadays, climate change is becoming a global issue that can no longer be ignored by governments, corporations and the general public. As a result, the roles that each play in combating this issue is one of heated debate. From my perspective, governments, big companies and individuals are all playing a vital important role in combating climate change.

Goverments, in my opinion, should play the chief role in fighting climate change as they have the legistive,administrative and executive power. This means that governments are authorized to enforce laws and regulations to control the emission and publicise the protection to the environment both locally and globally. For example, laws and regulations could be publised to deter the activities which are detrimental to the environment and motivate every single citizen to protect the environment.

Big companies, especially multi-national corporations play the second largest role in combating the climate change. To be more specific, low emission and environmental friendly manufacturing process should be applied for environmental protection which is able to make a substantial difference on slowing the process of climate change, reducing pollution and saving natural resources.

The behaviours of individuals also have a huge impact on the environment which means that personal behaviours may negatively or positively affect the climate due to the size effect. As an illustration, if more people choose to drive less and recycle more, the carbon emission and the amount of waster produced everyday can be drastically reduced.

To conclude, government, big companies and individual are all playing big roles in stopping climate change and should take responsibility to contribute to protecting environment locally and globally.
