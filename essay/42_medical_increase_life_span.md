###Question
The medical technology is responsible for increasing the average life expectancy. Do you think it is a curse or a blessing?

###Answer
Innovations in medical science have made it possible for people to sustain a healthy and longer life span. People are now able to get fit even faster than ever before, thanks to new pharmaceutical drugs. But the question is that is this a positive situation or the consequence which are more likely to bring problems for individuals and society as a whole.

Firstly, when it comes to benefits that stem from this trend, people can enjoy more life with their beloved ones. Even in many cases, it has been seen that many great grandparents are now, due to the increased life expectancy rate, able to see their great-grandchildren and can disseminate their experiences and wisdom among them. As a result, their younger generations are becoming more astute and competitive.

Additionally, prolonged and healthy life can enable them to stay working for a longer period which eventually helps them to stay independent and in charge of their own lives and decisions. Apart from that, not only do individuals are acquiring such expertise from their elderly, but business finds it profitable to retain their old skilled employees for longer.

On the contrary, potential problems are looming for new generations who might be thinking of finding employment in reputed companies. The reason for this is old people might go on working at the same positions and can create a tough competitive environment for those who have any experience in those respective fields.

To put in a nutshell, this phenomenon certainly has some negative impacts including causing a fierce job market for young generations. However, the positives of this situation are immense.
