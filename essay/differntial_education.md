### Discuss whether school should differentiate students according to their academic performance?

Recently, there's a trend that high school provide differential education to students according to their academic performance. A heat debate has been sparked on its advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, this pattern may bring immediate benefits, but it lacks consideration for long term impact.

On one side, it is obvious that differential education could offer tailored courses contents for students, where teachers can organize the slides to maximum student's learning outcome. For example, talented students could study higher level textbooks, rather than to study what they've already mastered. By doing so, genius can accelerate their learning process and produce value to the society as early as possible.

On the other side, there's concern against the potential workloads and pressures for students. Learing environment is vital to a person's learning, which means his surroundings make great impact on his behaviour. In that sense, if poor performance students are grouped together, it's risky that these students may become even less concentrated, which leads to the bigger gaps between talented students and poor performance students.

To conclude, to split students into different groups based on their knowledge level would bring some benefits and to maximum student's learning outcomes. However school should be aware of the negative impacts and take this approach for a proportion of courses while keep the students as a whole group at most of the time.
