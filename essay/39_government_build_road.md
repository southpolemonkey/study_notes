### Question
As cities expanding, some people claim governments should look forward creating better networks of public transportation available for everyone rather than building more roads for vehicle owning population. Whatâ€™s your opinion? Give some examples or experience to support

### Answer
As urban population density increasing, a debated on whether governments should allocate funds on public transportation or building roads arises. From my perspective, both sides are vital to the development of cities.

On one side, those who support creating better networks of public transportation argue public transportation reduces congestion. In many large cities, especially in peak hour, traffic congestion puts stress on daily commuters and affect people's mental health because the congest makes them even more exhausted after a day's work.

Besides, public transportation is a cost-effective way for daily commuters who otherwise may spend much more by driving themselves. In other words, compared with driving, public transport saves energy, produce less air pollution, and protect the environment. For instance, some cities' transportation departments have already used electricity bus which leads to zero emissions. Moreover, replace privates cars with buses and trains means fewer cars on the roads, indicating a lower rate of traffic accidents, thus improving the safety of all passengers.

On the other hand, building roads could link people better. In specific, urban and rural areas can build a relationship with each other and promote urbanization. For instance, some countryside towns would transport their agriculture goods to urban after the road networks are upgraded, which means more sources of income for farmers. The complex road network is also a symbol of cities' infrastructures.

To conclude, governments should promote public transportation and encourage people to drive less to protect our environment. Meanwhile, building a mature road system should also be put at high priority as it is vital to cities' future development.
