## 22. Children Allowance
Although many people argue it is not a good idea to pay child for work around the home, paying children to do extra work around the house actually can be useful by providing child an understanding of how a business work, it also open the door to future saving and investing by learning the power of compound interest from Bank's personal finance services.

## 36. Birth Order
While parents' own born order can become an issue when dynamics in the family they are raising replicate the family in which they were raised, the parent has to be the grown up and step out of that battle, also whether or not you subscribe to theories that birth order can affect your child's personality, it is important for both parents and kids to realize that, despite the characteristics often associated with birth order, you're not locked into any role.

## 37. Tree Ring
Although it's straightforward to count the rings inwards, it's less straightforward to attach a date to a particular ring, but dendrochronologists have constructed tree ring records by noting the sequence of wider and narrower rings in a tree cut down in a known recent year compared with those cut down at various times in the past, which reflects the amount of rain and also allow them to reconstruct the past climate.

## 38. Comparative Advantage
While developing countries specialize in the production of labour intensive product, United States specialize in the production of goods that are human and physical capital intensive, this division of global production should yield higher global output of both types of goods, however, once these technologies become well understood and production processes use less skilled labour, production will migrate to countries with less expensive labour.

## 39. School Liaison Police
While armed police have been brought into schools to reduce crime rates and educate students, they will build positive relationships between police and students, and it would be a good thing and an innovative idea and there could be some positive benefits, however, parent groups warned of potential dangers of armed police working at schools in communities where police relations were already under strain, which means it may spark a range of community reactions.

## 40. US vs Indian IT
Although India is able to provide both computer programming and innovative new technologies at a lower dollar cost than the United States, it does not mean that United States will lose programming jobs and innovative technology job, the reason why United States has a comparative advantage in technology innovation partly is because it is easy to obtain capital to undertake such long-run projects, which means American firms will shift to more and more innovation.

## 41. Australian Education
While Australians often seem to accept that a country cannot achieve both educational quality or equity at the same time, and curriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so, but the need to improve the quality of education is well accepted to strengthen their human capital to underpin their modern, knowledge economies, and improved equity in education is also important for social cohesion.

## 45. Beauty Contest
While there has been an increase in interest in beauty pageants in Australia, there is a debate as to whether beauty pageants are reminders of old fashioned values or a throwback to the days when women were respected for how good they looked, opponents argue that beauty pageants traps young women to go on a diet although most have a normal BMI, which are profoundly hazardous to the mental health of young Australians.

## 49. Volstead Act
While the Volstead Act prohibited the manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, delivery, or possession of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, there was a loophole where fruit juice was made into concentrate and then used for making wine, but the government prevented illegal wine production later, after which American wine industry came to a halt.

## 56. Voting in Australia
While Australia is one of the few democratic countries where voting is compulsory, compulsory voting is actually not democratic at all, as citizens are forced to vote by making the quickest and easiest choice without understanding the political views just because they will be fined if they do not, but it will be much better if the votes come from people who have understood the political views carefully.

## 57. Voting in UK
While voting is important to make your voice heard on issues that concern you, many countries across the world fought for rights to vote, but voting rate has dropped substantially because of ‘voter apathy’, and reasons of low participate rate in the election are far more complicated, so politicians and most media should take concerted effort to encourage people to vote.
