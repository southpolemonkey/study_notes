### Question
Some universities deduct studentsâ€™ marks if work is given late. What is your opinion and recommend some alternative actions for this problem?

### Answer
In recent years, it becomes common for universities to deduct students' marks for the late submission. This approach
sparks a debate on whether it is effective or not. From my perspective, such approach is understandable while better alternatives
could be proposed.

On one hand, to have penalty on late submission guarantees the fair of the evaluation process and fair for students
who submit on time. If late submission students get the same mark as those who follow the deadline, the process is biased and unfair.
In addition, university is a place where students learn the discipline and order, to follow the deadline is vital for 
them to become responsible in the future's work after graduation. If a person can not stick to the deadline, the project
will be delay and the company will bear economic loss.

On the other hand, penalty is considered as a way of negative motivation, which means students are not positively
motivated because they are more afraid of receiving penalty if they can't make the submission on time. As a result, 
this approach restricts student's creative thinking, the out-of-box ideas as students are concerned with the potential dealy
from implementing new idea in the project. In the long term, students may be bounded with the deadline and therefore 
lack enthusiastic towards new technology.

In order to transform those negative motivation into positive one, universities could try to give bonus points
to those who submit at the early stage, therefore, students have more incentives to stimulate them to start
as early as possible.

To conclude, penalizing late submission in understandable as they educates young people to follow discipline and obey
the rules. Meanwhile, new approaches such as giving bonus points for early submission should be considered to stimulate 
students' motivation as well.
