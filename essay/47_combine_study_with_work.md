### Question
In order to study effectively, it requires comfort, peace and time. So it is impossible for a student to combine learning and employment at the same time, because one distracts the other. Is it realistic to combine them at the same time? Support your opinion with examples.

### Answer
Some people think students should be provided comfort, peace and time to study effectively, so it is unrealistic to study while work simultaneously. While other people argue that it is achievable. From my perspective, work does not contradict the purpose of study.

Truly, students should concentrate on study as learning knowledge is the top priority in their stage. In the modern
society where competition is fierce, students need sufficient theoretic knowledge to become valuable for the employers.
Hence, it makes sense to advice that students avoid the distraction to focus completely in absorbing knowledge.

However, working gives students unique life experience and knowledge they can't gain from textbooks. Firstly, working can broaden student's networking,
which accumulates the resources for future development. During the process, students' communication skills and social skills are enhanced, these skills
are criteria employers looking for. Also, students can put what they learnt into practice, which deepens the understanding of theoretic knowledge from textbooks.
For instance, only after have hands-on experience in project management do students understand the methodology outlined in textbooks.

Furthermore, to spend time in part time job can enhance practice skills such as management skills, they can learn how to interact with others
from different background, and how to handle disputes during this process. In addition, gaining experience is helpful to improve 
competitiveness of students in future job hunting.

To conclude, student need to put top priority in studying knowledge as it leads them to a bright future. Meanwhile,
students should be encouraged to get involved in with the society through working, which is a new source of knowledge.
