Mingzhu and I decided to visit Mt Wilson today to see the autumn of Sydney. Mt. Wilson is famous for its surrounding maple leaves which produces colourfulness at the moment. We picked windyridge garden as our destination as it has kept on my list for a while, and today it's a good time to tick it off my list.

We drove along Epping road, Beecroft road and had a short stop at Castel Hill shopping mall, and we were quite impressed by the volumn of business there. The 4 stored mall is new yet has anything people need. We also did some shopping at Best & Less and Kmart to get ourselves pairs of new slippers, which later turned out to be the smartest decision we made. 

After leaving Castel hills, we followed the road leading to kellyville, Windsor and  Rousehill. By a wrong turn, we drove along Schofieldsroad, where we saw this newly developed area with shiny houses on one side of the road, while the vast empty ground on the other side (lots of potentials!). Not long a ago, I heard this suburb from a friend, whom said that it would be developed into the next Parramatta, where high percentage of Indian immigrants will flock into. Business wise, the not too far Norwest busines park would potentially provides job opportunities for this area. 

We then passed Richmond, which I felt was a bit ancient town with traditional looking hotels and bars. After Richmond, we enter the hills area where the landscape became high and low, from Google map, it was called Kurrajong Hills, no idea where the name comes from, but the scena indicates that area more like a resort or holiday space, at least I'm guessing the residents should be relatively older, maybe most of them have retired and come here to enjoy the life. The road leading to Mt Wilson is fun to drive, I've been missing driving hills road for a while (becaue of the covid), it was interesting to notice Bilpin, a village almost full of orchards, well, apple to be more specific, the billboard appears one after another. We will stop next time to have a apple and maybe a cider next time!

After nearly two hours drive after leaving Castel hills, and lots of twisted roads, we were finally at windyridge garden, a decent well designed private garden. The entree fee is $10 for adult, and provides some hot tea and biscuits, which is lovely in winter. The garden was enjoyable and fun to explore, while a bit noisy with groups of visitor, I'd rather stay one night next time so that we can enjoy the whole garden by ourselves to experience the feeling of garden owners.The avenue outside the garden has mutliple good spots for shooting, and we gave us couple satisfactory picture. 

On our way back, we merged to A2 via Windsor and took M2 express way at Bella Vista, where Woolworth group sits. Even though I know Bella Vista is damn far, the actual driving from there to Macquaire Park still somewhat scares me if I would need to drive to woolworth eveyday, and the toll fee ($7.8) is relatively expensive too.
